Since the blossoming of environmentalism a half-century ago, those most concerned and involved in responding to these challenges have recognized that a robust engagement with law is required for reversing or mitigating these changes. This has resulted in a massive body of environmental law from local land use regulations to national environmental regulatory regimes and international conventions. While some of this has been effective, the velocity of global political, economic and cultural change appears to undermine or render ineffective many legal interventions. As scientists revise predictions regarding the severity and rate of environmental degradation, doubts have been raised about the sufficiency or capacity of existing law to respond appropriately.\u00a0 This course undertakes a broad, critical examination of the role of law in promoting and perhaps impeding environmental sustainability and asks what this reveals about the possibilities and limits of law. It begins by posing such questions as: Does \"sustainability\" entail sacrifice? If so, what role do distinctively legal practices and institutions play in giving effect to such sacrifices? Might something that we feel is fundamental to law itself need to be sacrificed? Following a brief survey of key aspects of existing environmental law, in which we assess what has and has not worked, we will engage a range of recent arguments in environmental legal theory (such as earth justice, wild law, green legal theory) which ask us to rethink what we want--or need--law to be.\nLimited to 30 students.

MacAdam (Section 01)\nWhat is meant by \u201cnatural law\u201d? This course will\u00a0explore this strange legal category from the ancient world through the present\u00a0day. What\u00a0connection did (or does) natural law have to the will of a God\u00a0or other deity, and yet how has it also become something separate from \u201cdivine\u00a0law\u201d?\u00a0What is \u201cnatural\u201d about natural law, and does this quality make it\u00a0somehow more primitive than, or prior to, or better than, positive\u00a0(government-made) law? In modern secular societies, what are the\u00a0post-religious understandings of the natural law idea, which is still thought\u00a0by some to encompass our intuitions about justice or to frame our conceptions\u00a0of positive law?\nIn exploring the history and present state of this order\u00a0of law which, in different moments, seems both to found positive law and to\u00a0go\u00a0beyond it, we will also ask: why\u00a0is natural law traditionally associated with the \u201claw of nations\u201d or\u00a0international law? How easily does natural law--particularly in the form of common\u00a0law and the practices of\u00a0judicial review--coexist with\u00a0positive law?\u00a0If these two\u00a0conflict, which are we bound to\u00a0follow? Does natural law jurisprudence have a substantial role to play in\u00a0actual legal proceedings? Can it govern\u00a0conduct between governments as\u00a0well as (or instead of) individuals? Can natural law be a justification\u00a0for disobedience to the laws of governments,\u00a0or even for revolution?\nLimited to 30 students. Fall semester.
