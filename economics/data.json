The course is especially suitable for students interested in mathematical modeling in economics and students considering doing research in economics.\nGive preference to economics majors ","Department Code":"ECON","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1415S/ECON/ECON-441-1415S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite: ECON 300/301, ECON 330/331, and MATH 211 (or MATH 121 with consent of instructor).
