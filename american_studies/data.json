Are they Latinos or are they Black? Afro-Latinos are African-descended peoples from Latin America and the Caribbean who reside in the United States. In this course, a focus on Afro-Latinos allows us to study the history of racial ideologies and racial formation in the Americas.\nWe take a multi-layered approach to the study of modern Afro-Latino history (late nineteenth century to the twentieth century). First, the history of Afro-Latinos has been shaped by the historical relationship between race and nation in Latin America. Therefore, we look closely at the varied histories of African-descended peoples in Latin American countries. Second, the historical relationship between the United States and Latin America has shaped the experience of Afro-Latinos who reside in the U.S. The long history of U.S. economic dominance and military interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean generated an equally long history of Latin American migration to the U.S. In the twentieth century black migrants came from nations that promoted myths of racial democracy to a nation that practiced racial segregation and violence. Afro-Latino migrants experienced racial segregation and violence in the U.S. in ways similar to but different than other Latinos and African Americans. Therefore, third, we examine the history of Afro-Latinos in relation to Latinos in the U.S. The history of Latinos is at the core of U.S. continental expansion, labor practices, and exclusionary citizenship. The category \u201cLatino\u201d has also been shaped by racial hierarchies. The relatively new category of \u201cAfro-Latino\u201d allows us to examine a history that has been silenced within the broader categories of \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cAfrican American.\u201d\nIn this course, we examine how Afro-Latinos maneuvered between different racial contexts in Latin American nations and the United States. It is a history that highlights the competing and conflicting racial ideologies that have shaped the Americas.\nLimited to 20 students.\u00a0 Spring semester.\u00a0 Professor del Moral.\nPriority given to American Studies and Black Studies majors.","Department Code":"BLST","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516S/BLST/BLST-331-1516S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(104, 147, 93)","size":10.0},{"label":"AMST-326","x":21.0,"y":3.0,"id":"21","attributes":{"Title":"Immigration and the New Latino Second Generation","Description":"Listed in: \n, as AMST-326\u00a0 | \u00a0\n, as SOCI-326\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n(Offered as AMST 326 and SOCI 326.)\u00a0 This course focuses on Latino immigrant youth and the children of Latino immigrants who are coming of age in the contemporary United States, what social scientists have termed the \u201cnew second generation.\u201d Currently this generation is the fastest growing demographic of children under 18 years of age.

Building on a survey of crucial works in the American Political Development (APD) literature and on general approaches (rational choice, sociological, etc.) to understanding institutional change, this course will introduce ways of thinking historically about political institutions in the U.S. Why did the party system evolve the way it did? Where did the rules and procedures of Congress come from? Where and when did important public services (transportation and communication infrastructure, protection for property, social insurance, etc.) become the provenance of state bureaucracies? How has the function and power of the Presidency changed over time? How did western expansion, imperialism, and military experience shape the federal government? These are a few of the substantive questions we will address in this course.\nMore broadly, however, this course helps us think about politics in a temporal way. History and political science are intrinsically related, but to understand the current debates and questions we need to be explicit about the types of processes (long-term, short-term, episodic, cyclic, etc.) that shape the institutions and events we see. Hence a key component of this course will be interrogating how scholars address the historiographic problem of studying politics, with the aim of cultivating the analytic tools necessary to situate contemporary political debates in the stream of time.\nPriority first given to fourth-year students, then to a balance of sophomores and juniors, randomly determined, followed by first-year students and 5-college students.","Department Code":"POSC","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516S/POSC/POSC-319-1516S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite: An introductory Political Science course in IL (200 level or above) or any U.S. History course\u00a0 (100 level or above) or HIST 301 or AMST 468 or LSJT 222.

Film and literary texts in particular will provide primary grounding for our inquiries. By keeping popular culture, representation, and the nature of historical narrative in mind, we will consider the often mutually constitutive relationship between American identity and Indian identity as we pose the following questions: How have imaginings of a national space and national culture by Americans been shaped by a history marked by conquest and reconciliation with indigenous peoples? And, how has the creation of a national American literary tradition often defined itself as both apart from and yet indebted to Native American cultural traditions? This course also considers how categories like race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and religion have contributed to discussions of citizenship and identity, and changed over time with particular attention to specific Native American individuals and tribal nations.

In this course, we study Puerto Rican migration in the twentieth-century. In 1898, the United States invaded and occupied the island as part of its expansion into the Caribbean region during the Cuban War of Independence. Since then, Puerto Rico has remained a colonial territory of the United States. We will discuss the historical patterns of migration that emerged as a result of this century-long colonial relationship. Through the case study of Puerto Rican migration, we will engage broad topics, including empire, colonialism, labor radicalism, patriarchy, language, and cultural identities. The course is organized in four units.\nFirst, we discuss the 1898 war, the U.S. occupation, and the early migration of Puerto Rican workers to Hawaii, an American territory in the Pacific. We also examine the migration of radicals and workers to the United States, a history connected to the great migration of black Caribbean radicals to the northeast. Second, the 1940s to the 1960s marks the \u201cgreat migration\u201d of industrial and agricultural workers to the United States. Some made a permanent move to the mainland, while others, like Mexican \n, travelled for short work contracts. Third, we examine the return migration of the 1970s, which was shaped by the great cultural production and radical politics of the New York and Chicago communities. Finally, we move to the 1990s and beyond. By then, the greater Puerto Rican diaspora in the United States was firmly established in different regions of the mainland. These different communities began to receive a new generation of workers, civil servants, and professionals in numbers that rivaled the great mid-century experience. Today, more Puerto Ricans live on the mainland than the island.\nLimited to 20 students.\u00a0 Fall semester.\u00a0 Professor del Moral.\nPriority given to American Studies majors.","Department Code":"AMST","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516F/AMST/AMST-317-1516F'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(68, 134, 204)","size":10.0},{"label":"ENGL-458","x":24.0,"y":4.0,"id":"25","attributes":{"Title":"Indigenous American Epics","Description":"Listed in: \n, as AMST-358\u00a0 | \u00a0\n, as ENGL-458\n (Section 01)\n(Offered as ENGL 458 and AMST 358.)\u00a0 [before 1800]\u00a0 This course will delve deeply into the literature and history of \u201cTurtle Island,\u201d or North America.\u00a0 The Quich\u00e9 Maya \n (Council Book), the Iroquois Great Law, and the Wabanaki creation cycle are rooted in longstanding, complex oral narratives of emergence and transformation, which were recorded by Native authors and scribes.\u00a0 We will close read these epics (in English) as works of \u201cancient American\u201d literature, as narratives of tribal history, and as living constitutions of tribal governance.\u00a0 We will study the tribally and regionally-specific contexts of these epic narratives as well as the \u201cintellectual trade routes\u201d that link them together.\u00a0 The course will conclude with an epic narrative of more recent colonial history, composed by the nineteenth-century Pequot author William Apess, born in the Connecticut River valley.\u00a0 Following an interdisciplinary American studies approach, our reading will be enriched by guest speakers and artistic media.\nOpen to juniors and seniors.\u00a0 Limited to 15 students.\u00a0 Spring semester.\u00a0 Professor Brooks.\nPreference given to junior and senior majors in English and American Studies and to students pursuing a Five College certificate in Native American Studies.","Department Code":"ENGL","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516S/ENGL/ENGL-458-1516S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(150, 179, 153)","size":10.0},{"label":"AMST-490","x":25.0,"y":4.0,"id":"26","attributes":{"Title":"Democratizing Higher Ed","Description":"Listed in: \n, as AMST-490\nMoodle site: \n (Section 02)","Department Code":"AMST","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516F/AMST/AMST-490-02-1516F'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(68, 134, 204)","size":10.0},{"label":"AMST-302","x":26.0,"y":3.0,"id":"27","attributes":{"Title":"Globalization, Inequality and Social Change","Description":"Listed in: \n, as AMST-302\u00a0 | \u00a0\n, as SOCI-302\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n(Offered as AMST 302 and SOCI 302.)\u00a0 This course is an in-depth exploration of the increasing global interconnectedness of economic, political, and social processes, what many have come to call \u201cglobalization.\u201d We begin by developing a sociological critique of the relationship between inequality, post-World War II global capitalism, and the neoliberal ideology that underlies it. \u00a0We do this through study of the major institutions and actors that endorse and perpetuate global capitalism.
