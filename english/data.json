By studying literature, we enable ourselves to do much more than that. Studying literature makes it possible to recover a relationship to language that we all once had, in which words and their interrelationships were new, strange, and rich with possibility. It makes it possible to develop a more acute awareness of the ongoing tension between language as units of meaning (words, phrases, sentences) and language as units of sound (the beat of syllables, the harmonization of one syllable with another). It even makes it possible for us to carry this sense of everything that is uncanny about language\u2013the medium of our relationship to others and to ourselves\u2013into our lives more generally, to recognize that in just about everything that we say, we mean more than we mean to mean. People who study literature are people who are capable of taking away from conversations, no less than from poems, much more than the gist, the summary, the bottom line. By dwelling on texts patiently, by slowing down the process of moving from mystery to certainty, by opening ourselves to the crosscurrents of potential meanings that are present at every moment in just about every sentence, it is possible for us to become more accurate and nuanced readers of just about everything that happens in our lives.\nPreference given to first-year students and sophomores.\u00a0 Limited to 15 students.\u00a0 Fall semester.\u00a0 Visiting Professor Berek and Professor Sanborn.\nIf over-enrolled, enrollment will be by permission of the instructor, on the basis of written account of need and desire for the class.","Department Code":"ENGL","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516F/ENGL/ENGL-105-1516F'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(55, 122, 63)","size":10.0},{"label":"ENGL-499","x":52.0,"y":4.0,"id":"51","attributes":{"Title":"Senior Tutorial","Description":"Listed in: \n, as ENGL-499\nFormerly listed as: ENGL-88\n (Section 01)\nStudents intending to continue independent work begun in ENGL\u00a0498 are required to submit a five-page prospectus describing in detail the shape of the intended project along with a substantial writing sample from the work completed in English 498.
