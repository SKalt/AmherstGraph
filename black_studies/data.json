It was also a decade fraught with contradictions. On the one hand, Americans experienced widespread disillusionment with the power of the federal government to promote and protect the minority from the majority. Historians seeking to understand the collapse of the welfare state or the origins of white resistance to civil rights\u2019 initiatives most often point to the 1970s as the time when the Supreme Court abandoned school desegregation and the federal government shifted the burden of the social welfare system onto the market, state and local governments, and onto poor people themselves. And yet, the 1970s also saw an explosion of progressive social activism, as the women\u2019s movement, the gay rights movement, and the environmental movement, among others, all came into their own. Likewise, this was also a time of U.S. retreat and military overextension, and a time of new hegemonies of human rights regimes and multinational corporations. This course asks students to consider how connecting the local with the global can help us better understand and resolve these apparent contradictions. How does our understanding of American politics, society, and culture change depending upon our point of view? What are the possibilities and limitations of global and local methods of inquiry? How might historians more fruitfully combine sub-disciplines to understand the ways in which Americans experienced and engaged with their historical realities as members of local, national, and global communities?\u00a0 One class meeting per week. \nLimited to 25 students.\u00a0 Fall semester.\u00a0 Professors Moss and Walker.\nPriority to History majors, Black Studies majors, and then by class--seniors, juniors, sophomore, first year students","Department Code":"BLST","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1415F/BLST/BLST-342-1415F'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(62, 59, 69)","size":10.0},{"label":"RELI-238","x":19.0,"y":2.0,"id":"18","attributes":{"Title":"African-American Religious History","Description":"Listed in: \n, as BLST-238\u00a0 | \u00a0\n, as RELI-238\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n(Offered as RELI 238 and BLST 238 [US]. \u00a0A study of African-American religion, from the time of slavery to the present, in the context of American social, political, and religious history.\u00a0 Consideration will be given to debates concerning the \"Africanity\" of black religion in the United States, to the role of Islam in African-American religious history, and to the religious impact of recent Caribbean immigration.\u00a0 The major emphasis throughout the course, however, will be on the history of African-American Christianity in the United States.\u00a0 Topics covered will include the emergence of African-American Christianity in the slavery era, the founding of the independent black churches (especially the AME church) and their institutional development in the nineteenth century, the predominant role of the black Baptist denominations in the twentieth century, the origins and growth of black Pentecostalism, the increasing importance of African-American Catholicism, the role of the churches in social protest movements (especially the civil rights movement) and electoral politics, the changing forms of black theology, and the distinctive worship traditions of the black churches.\nFall semester.\u00a0 Professor Wills.","Department Code":"RELI","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1415F/RELI/RELI-238-1415F'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(89, 200, 19)","size":10.0},{"label":"POSC-260","x":20.0,"y":2.0,"id":"19","attributes":{"Title":"African Politics","Description":"Listed in: \n, as BLST-277\u00a0 | \u00a0\n, as POSC-260\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n(Offered as POSC 260 [G] and BLST 227.)\u00a0 Students will develop a rich understanding of African politics from the pre-colonial period to the present and will be able to analyze and discuss contemporary African politics in light of historical forces.

Our aim is to gain some understanding of geographies of race \u201con-the-ground\u201d in real places, and of the role of legal practices--especially legal argument--in efforts to challenge and reinforce these racial geographies. We will ask, for example, how claims about responsibility, community, rationality, equality, justice, and democracy have been used to justify or resist both racial segregation and integration, access and expulsion. In short, we will ask how moral argument and legal discourse have contributed to the formation of the geographies of race that we all inhabit.

This seminar will examine the development of several outbreaks of violence in Africa in the colonial and post-colonial periods to explore important questions in a comparative context. We will look at the economic, social, religious, and political roots of these disturbances; at the challenges faced both by rebel groups attempting to gain a foothold and by states with a fragile hold on ruling authority; and at the social disruptions caused by the participation of child and youth soldiers in various conflicts. We will also discuss the problems historians face in trying to narrate and analyze revolts whose strength often emerged from their protean character, and the legends and rumors that frequently swirled around violent revolts and their role in the construction of historical narratives. The events studied will include the Maji-maji rebellion in German-controlled Tanganyika in 1906-1907; the first (1896-1897) and second (1960-1980) Chimurengas (revolts) in southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe; the widespread revolt in the 1980s and '90s in South Africa against the apartheid regime; and the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army in northern Uganda in the late 1990s.

Are they Latinos or are they Black? Afro-Latinos are African-descended peoples from Latin America and the Caribbean who reside in the United States. In this course, a focus on Afro-Latinos allows us to study the history of racial ideologies and racial formation in the Americas.\nWe take a multi-layered approach to the study of modern Afro-Latino history (late nineteenth century to the twentieth century). First, the history of Afro-Latinos has been shaped by the historical relationship between race and nation in Latin America. Therefore, we look closely at the varied histories of African-descended peoples in Latin American countries. Second, the historical relationship between the United States and Latin America has shaped the experience of Afro-Latinos who reside in the U.S. The long history of U.S. economic dominance and military interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean generated an equally long history of Latin American migration to the U.S. In the twentieth century black migrants came from nations that promoted myths of racial democracy to a nation that practiced racial segregation and violence. Afro-Latino migrants experienced racial segregation and violence in the U.S. in ways similar to but different than other Latinos and African Americans. Therefore, third, we examine the history of Afro-Latinos in relation to Latinos in the U.S. The history of Latinos is at the core of U.S. continental expansion, labor practices, and exclusionary citizenship. The category \u201cLatino\u201d has also been shaped by racial hierarchies. The relatively new category of \u201cAfro-Latino\u201d allows us to examine a history that has been silenced within the broader categories of \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cAfrican American.\u201d\nIn this course, we examine how Afro-Latinos maneuvered between different racial contexts in Latin American nations and the United States.

The study of Hispaniola provides us the opportunity to explore the history of revolution, state-building, citizenship, US empire, national identities, and migration.\nLimited to 20 students.\u00a0 Spring semester.\u00a0 Professor del Moral.\nPriority given to American Studies and Black Studies majors.","Department Code":"AMST","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516S/AMST/AMST-311-1516S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(82, 78, 217)","size":10.0},{"label":"BLST-291","x":50.0,"y":2.0,"id":"51","attributes":{"Title":"Black Radicalism in the Global South","Description":"Listed in: \n, as BLST-291\u00a0 | \u00a0\n, as HIST-291\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n(Offered as BLST 291[D] and HIST 291[AF/c]) This course will examine the geographic formation contemporary scholars have identified as the \"Global South,\" and explore how it has been historically infused by the political struggles of people throughout the African Diaspora. Transnational in scope, this course will address the American South, the Caribbean and Africa, placing the history of colonialism and decolonization alongside--and in dialogue with--efforts to achieve racial justice in the United States.\u00a0 In turn, we will probe how the Global South simultaneously nurtured, and was created by, the emergence and development of a Black Radical Tradition, and broader notions of black diasporic identity. Through close readings of primary sources, this course will establish pioneering intellectuals such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Eric Williams, Frantz Fanon, Ella Baker, Stokely Carmichael, Claudia Jones and CLR James as \"southern\" critics of racism and western modernity. In turn, this course will assess the black radical's relationship to modes of thought (particularly liberalism, nationalism and Marxism) initially articulated outside the Global South. Finally, we will critically assess the extent, and limitations, of such efforts to \"make the world anew.\"\nFall semester.\u00a0 Visiting Lecturer Hickmott.","Department Code":"BLST","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516F/BLST/BLST-291-1516F'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(62, 59, 69)","size":10.0},{"label":"BLST-296","x":51.0,"y":2.0,"id":"52","attributes":{"Title":"The Concept of Race","Description":"Listed in: \n, as BLST-296\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n[US] What do we mean by the term \"race\"?\u00a0 From where does the concept come and what role did \"race\" play in white Western modernity? Is \"race\" always a destructive concept, or can it be re-defined and re-deployed as part of critical and emancipatory projects? This course explores the concept of race in three basic moments. First, we will look at how our contemporary language of race originated in the Enlightenment and was conceived and justified by some of the key figures of white Western intellectual life, including John Locke, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and G.W.F. Hegel. This genealogical moment reveals race-thinking as foundational to European identity. Second, we will read and critically assess contemporary theorizations of race in order to see how notions of blackness are generated and to what extent, if any, those notions are defensible as liberatory ideas. This political moment critically examines the relationship between identity, tradition, and ideas of race.\u00a0 Third, we will explore how whiteness has been conceived across history in relation to abject racial categories and how whiteness survives, functions, and exercises power in forms of invisibility and hyper-visibility. This analytical moment interrogates the relationship between whiteness as a political identity and anti-Black violence and terror.\nFall semester.
