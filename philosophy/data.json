In a more specialized usage developed by Immanuel Kant, autonomy refers to the idea that an individual governs herself through her own capacity for reason, the very same capacity which accounts for her moral duties to others. In both the ordinary and Kantian sense, autonomy is an attractive ideal. After all, it makes the individual, rather than anyone else, the guide to her own life. Yet much Continental philosophy after Kant criticizes this ideal. After briefly orienting ourselves to the Kantian understanding through a reading of selections from his moral writings, we take up the charges that the ideal of autonomy is: (1) alienating, in that it blinds us to important ways in which we are shaped by other people; (2) empty, in that without historical context it can tell us nothing about how we should act; (3) contingent, in that it represents a value that arose through concrete power struggles; and (4) patriarchal, in that it is a product of gender-based domination that denies the importance of other values. Along the way, we consider alternative ways of thinking about ethics and the self. Readings will be from Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Nietzsche, and de Beauvoir.\nPreference to majors, then by class and to those who attend first class.

It is so basic to our thought, and so fundamental to the world we think about, that philosophers have despaired of saying much more about it. Some have even suggested that we should dispense with talk of \u201cidentity.\u201d Yet, issues of identity are at the center of many important philosophical issues, for example, the relation between mind and body, the constitution of persons, and the nature of scientific discovery. And recent philosophers have done much to illuminate the nature of identity by studying its logic and grammar, and by asking how it interacts with other fundamental phenomena.\nIn the first part of this seminar, we will explore some puzzles revealed by these recent investigations. Identity and meaning: why exactly is it more informative to say that Lady Gaga is Stefani Germanotta than it is to say that Lady Gaga is identical to herself? Relative Identity: Should we say that one thing is identical to another, such as Barack Obama and the President of the United States, only relative to a functional role or a sortal concept? Contingent identity: could one thing, such as Water/H\n0, have been two, or two things one? Vague identity: is it coherent to hold that two things, such as the mountain(s) that rise to connected and nearby peaks, neither stand, nor fail to stand in the identity relation to one another? Identity and composition: is my reading lamp identical to the swarm of microphysical particles that compose it? Identity and change: how can a thing, such as a river, undergo change while retaining its identity?\nIn the second part of the course, we will use our general understanding of identity to explore the individuation of such entities as psychological states, musical works, events, and persons.

And yet states have powers that no individuals have. They collect taxes, put us in jail, draft us into the army, tell us what we can and cannot own, etc. In general, they compel us to do things in the name of a \"common good,\" even when that good conflicts with what we would individually prefer to do. In this course, an introduction to key concepts of Western political philosophy, we seek to understand what, if anything, could justify states having this power over us. To this end, we examine three philosophical issues raised by the state. (1) \n Is there any reason why we ought to obey the law? What are the grounds for legitimate civil disobedience? (2) \n What reasons are there to tax the rich in order to give to the poor? What is the role of the state in securing economic equality? And what else beyond income ought the state to redistribute? (3) \n If freedom is naturally thought of as the ability to do whatever one wants, how could being a citizen of the state (with all the constraints that involves) possibly make us free?\nReadings will be both classical and contemporary, including Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Berlin, Nozick, Rawls, and G.A.

These arguments are not only worth exploring in themselves but also because they take up many of the themes and concerns of classical political economy.\u00a0 At the end, we will consider the worries that Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno have raised about the Western market in mass cultural products (what they call \"the culture industry\").\nLimited to 25 students.

Some of the most interesting and most characteristic work in recent philosophy has been concerned with the problem of skepticism about the external world, i.e., roughly, the problem of how you know that your whole life isn\u2019t merely a dream. We will critically examine various responses to this problem and, possibly, consider some related issues such as relativism and moral skepticism. There will be readings from authors such as Wittgenstein, Moore, and Austin, and philosophers working today such as Dretske and Putnam.\nPreference to Philosophy Majors, Seniors, Juniors, etc. \n45.00","Department Code":"PHIL","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516S/PHIL/PHIL-461-1516S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite: Two courses in Philosophy or consent of the instructor.

Many species face extinction, forests are disappearing, and toxic wastes and emissions accumulate. The prospect of a general environmental calamity seems all too real.\nThis sense of crisis has spurred intense and wide-ranging debate over what our proper relationship to nature should be. This is the focus of the course. Among the questions we shall explore will be: What obligations, if any, do we have to non-human animals, to living organisms like trees, to ecosystems as a whole, and to future generations of humans? Do animals have rights we ought to respect? Is nature intrinsically valuable or merely a bundle of utilities for our benefit? Is there even a stable notion of \u201cwhat is natural\u201d that can be deployed in a workable environmental ethic? Do our answers to these questions result in some way from a culturally contingent \u201cimage\u201d we have of nature and our place within it?

Koltonski (Section 01)\nThe problem of political authority and obligation is arguably the central problem in political philosophy, at least in the Western liberal tradition. Arthur Ripstein captures this problem well in his \n(2009): \u201cStates claim powers that no private person could have. Not only can they collect taxes and imprison wrongdoers; they can impose binding resolutions on private disputes, restrict agents on grounds of public health, and regulate other aspects of social life. Defenders of limited government insist that the state\u2019s power to do these things must be subject to fundamental restrictions. Prior to any question of what factors properly \n the exercise of those powers, however, is the more basic question of the justification of those powers themselves: how can an institution, whose offices are filled with ordinary fallible human beings, be entitled to do things to people, or demand things of them, that none of those same human beings are entitled to do or demand on their own [as private persons]?\u201d (145)\nThis seminar will consider the main contemporary accounts of the state\u2019s authority over its citizens and the citizen\u2019s political obligations to her state or fellow citizens, as well as the important criticisms of these accounts.\nPriority will be given to majors, seniors, then juniors, etc. ","Department Code":"PHIL","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1415S/PHIL/PHIL-477-1415S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite:\u00a0 Two courses in Philosophy or consent of the instructor.\u00a0 Limited to 15 students.\u00a0 Spring semester.\u00a0 Visiting Professor Koltonski."]},"color":"rgb(117, 2, 140)","size":10.0},{"label":"PHIL-223","x":22.0,"y":2.0,"id":"23","attributes":{"Title":"Human Health: Rights and Wrongs","Description":"Listed in: \n, as PHIL-223\nFormerly listed as: PHIL-23\n (Section 01)\nU.S. citizens are currently faced with many important decisions about health care policy.

These issues, in turn, raise questions about the relative weight and nature of various goods\u00a0 (e.g., life, pain relief, health, privacy, autonomy, and relationships) and questions about the justice of various distributions of these goods between different individuals.\u00a0 Finally, our attempts to answer these questions will raise basic questions about the nature of rationality.\u00a0Is it possible to reach rational decisions about ethical matters, or is ethics merely subjective?\nLimited to 25 students and 12 will be enrolled in the course as a Writing Intensive course with an extra section.
