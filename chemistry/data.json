Four hours of class and four hours of laboratory per week.","Department Code":"CHEM","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516S/CHEM/CHEM-231-1516S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite: CHEM 221.\u00a0 Spring semester.\u00a0 Professors Bishop and Hansen.\u00a0"]},"color":"rgb(9, 253, 83)","size":10.0},{"label":"CHEM-361","x":8.5,"y":3.0,"id":"21","attributes":{"Title":"Physical Chemistry","Description":"Listed in: \n, as CHEM-361\nFormerly listed as: CHEM-43\n (Section 01)\nThe thermodynamic principles and the concepts of energy, entropy, and equilibrium introduced in CHEM 161 will be expanded.

It continues to be of vital importance in contemporary physics. In this course, we will explore the implications of this synthesis by combining Newton\u2019s dynamical laws with his Law of Universal Gravitation. We will solve a wide range of problems of motion by introducing a small number of additional forces. The concepts of work, kinetic energy, and potential energy will then be introduced. Conservation laws of momentum, energy, and angular momentum will be discussed, both as results following from the dynamical laws under restricted conditions and as general principles that go well beyond the original context of their deduction. Newton\u2019s laws will be applied to a simple continuous medium to obtain a wave equation as an approximation. Properties of mechanical waves will be discussed.

In this seminar, we will examine tracers and proxies for microbial activity present in rock, sediment, soil and porewater. Environments to be studied include hydrothermal vents, deep sedimentary basins, early Earth and possible extraterrestrial habitats. We will survey the major biologically relevant elements of the periodic table (C, O, S, N, Fe, P) and examine how these elements cycle through the environment, focusing on stable isotopic tracers of biological processes.
