This course will develop tools from information economics and apply them, primarily to macroeconomic problems.\u00a0 We will study situations in which adverse selection, moral hazard, limited commitment, and strategic behavior create impediments to trade and prevent private markets from achieving efficient results. Applications can include credit constraints, default and collateral, bank runs, labor market contracts, unemployment, time inconsistency, and social insurance.\nThe approach of the course is rigorous and analytical, focusing both on providing students with very general modeling skills and on applying these skills to specific economic questions. Requirements will include solving analytical problem sets, as well as reading and discussing theoretical research papers. The course is especially suitable for students interested in mathematical modeling in economics and students considering doing research in economics.\nGive preference to economics majors ","Department Code":"ECON","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1415S/ECON/ECON-441-1415S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite: ECON 300/301, ECON 330/331, and MATH 211 (or MATH 121 with consent of instructor).

Certain crucial experiments precipitated crises in our classical understanding to which these theories offered responses; in other instances, the theories implied strange and/or counterintuitive phenomena that were then investigated by crucial experiments. After an examination of the basics of Special Relativity, the quantum theory, and the important early experiments, we will consider their implications for model systems such as a particle in a box, the harmonic oscillator, and a simple version of the hydrogen atom. We will also explore the properties of nuclei and elementary particles, study lasers and photonics, and discuss some very recent experiments of interest in contemporary physics.
