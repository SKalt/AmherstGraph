Sexual choices in the bedroom, they claimed, shaped national identities and the direction of social and cultural development. Through a variety of programs, propaganda and legal codes, states such as Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy sought to regulate sexual behavior and promote specific gender roles and identities. The intervention of the state in the intimate lives of citizens in the twentieth century, however, was rooted in the transformations of state, culture and economy that took place long before the speeches of great dictators. This course explores the cultural debates surrounding sexual practices, medical theories of gender and sexuality, and the relationship between sexuality and state that shaped European societies in the twentieth century. In case studies from across the continent, the course explores a range of topics, including but not limited to the history of sex reform, prostitution, homosexuality, venereal disease, contraception, abortion, the \u201cNew Woman\u201d and sexual emancipation movements, sexual revolutions and reactionary movements and reproductive politics, among others.

In flare-ups over cartoons and Mohammed, or the veil and citizenship, the same comments repeat themselves. This repetitiveness begs the question of what constitutes liberalism, and whether religious belief, specifically Islam (but also in sensational coverage of practices such as polygamy), might be anathema to liberalism. If the American Constitution cherishes religious expression, why do even mainstream, dominant religions in the U.S. claim that they are under fire? Why does Islam remain a problem for pluralism even in a political philosophy designed to govern a multicultural society? Can there be liberal forms of Islam? This course seeks first to explore issues related generally to understanding the relationship of religious belief and practice to the politics of a liberal state and second to apply these to understanding the place of Islam and Muslims in liberal states. We will also discuss the law of religious accommodation in Canada and the United States, the related problem of multiculturalism, religious formulations of these problems, including contemporary writing by Jewish and Christian theologians, and historical Muslim responses to the possibility of non-Islamic rule.

This course provides a historical overview of conflicts over women's roles in family, the economy and the body politic. It addresses gains women have made as well as challenges they face in\u00a0relation to economic development, military conflict, domestic inequality, health, and religious and cultural beliefs. It will introduce students to a range of obstacles that have arisen--and continue to arise--in the struggle to ensure that women are treated as full and legitimate bearers of human rights.\u00a0 Materials will include some of the significant feminist critiques of human rights activities that have emerged from this struggle as well as a range of comparative views of advances and setbacks to women's rights in Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the U.S. \u00a0Students will become familiar with important instruments, strategies, and movements\u00a0intended to remedy the inequalities that affect women. \u00a0Students will be expected to write a substantial research paper and participate actively in class discussion.\u00a0 One class meeting per week.\nAdmission with consent of instructor.\u00a0 Limited to 15 students.\u00a0 Not open to first-year students.

How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power? In this interdisciplinary course, we will address these questions through an examination of the complex roles gender and sexuality play in the lives of people of African descent.

One challenge is how to value women\u2019s work fairly. One index of this challenge is that in workplaces across the world, women earn significantly less than men and are underrepresented in high status positions. What explains such gender gaps in the workplace? Taking an empirical, social-science perspective, this course will discuss three main aspects of gender and work. First, we will cover major theories of gender inequality, such as psychological stereotyping, social exclusion, structural barriers, and gendered socialization. Second, in learning about the sociological mechanisms of inequality in the workplace, we will expand our discussion to women\u2019s work in the family and examine how the conflicts individuals face when trying to have both career and family influence women\u2019s lives.

Both widely available and largely visible in nineteenth-century France, prostitutes inspired many negative stereotypes. But, as the very product of the culture that marginalized her, the prostitute offered an ideal vehicle for writers to criticize the hypocrisy of bourgeois mores. The socially stratified world of prostitutes, ranging from low-ranking sex workers to high-class courtesans, presents a fascinating microcosm of French society as a whole.
