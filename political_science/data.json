The most significant part of the course focuses on explaining three concepts of freedom: negative freedom, positive freedom, and republicanism (freedom as non-domination). The students will be introduced to the main proponents of each concept of freedom and the main critiques of each of these different ways of conceiving freedom. The other part of the course involves applying the theoretical knowledge of these different concepts of freedom to specific contemporary social and political issues which revolve around freedom, its meaning, how to safeguard and expand it, and which are often the cause of heated debates: what are the limits of religious freedom in our secularized societies, what are the limits of the freedom of speech and expression, when does the right of the government and external authorities to intervene in our personal lives conflict with our right to personal freedom/autonomy? Throughout the course it will become clear that the position one adopts on these and similar issues fundamentally relates to the way in which one conceives of freedom, and that the conceptualization of freedom is of great importance and not, as some philosophers and political scientists have argued, the matter of a debate that has caused much heat but little light.\u00a0 One or two courses in political theory/ philosophy useful but not required.\u00a0\nLimited to 15 students.\u00a0 Spring semester.\u00a0 Loewenstein Fellow Gescinska\nPreference will be given to political science majors. \n37.00","Department Code":"POSC","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1415S/POSC/POSC-346-1415S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":[]},"color":"rgb(59, 223, 160)","size":10.0},{"label":"POSC-117","x":1.0,"y":1.0,"id":"1","attributes":{"Title":"Transformative Ideas","Description":"Listed in: \n, as POSC-117\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n[PT] This course explores a series of ideas from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that have substantially changed the way people think about humanity in the Western world.\u00a0 Each idea is closely associated with an author.

These approaches are then applied to different dimensions of the relationship: (1) intra-hemispheric relations prior to World War II (the sources of U.S. interventionism and the response of Latin America); (2) political and security issues after World War II (the role of the Cold War in the hemisphere and U.S. reaction to instability in the region, with special emphasis on Cuba in the early 1960s, Peru in the late 1960s, Chile in the early 1970s, The Falklands War and Nicaragua in the 1980s); and (3) economic and business issues (the politics of foreign direct investment and trade, and the debt crisis in the 1980s).

Moreover, while nuclear energy is badly needed by many states for economic development, it can lay the foundations for the acquisition of the most powerful weapons in the world. Few countries embody the contradictions of nuclear power to the degree to which the United States does. The first country to detonate a nuclear device (and the only one to have used it in conflict), the U.S. quickly became the champion of anti-proliferation efforts; at the same time, while heavily relying on nuclear power, the U.S. also has displayed throughout its history a burgeoning \"Nuclear Fear,\" permeating, as Spencer Weart explains, various aspects of public life. This class explores the evolution through history of the U.S. foreign policy strategy on issues of nuclear proliferation (both horizontal and vertical), connecting it to the domestic debate on uses of nuclear power and nuclear research. The aim of the class is to explore the links between the domestic and the international dimension of the U.S. position on nuclear weapons: how did the Three Mile Island incident affect the U.S. posture on nuclear weapons reduction, if at all? How did the culture of containment during the Cold War affect the domestic debate on nuclear weapons? Under what conditions had the boundaries between domestic and international stances on nuclear power become porous, and when did they become fixed instead? The structure of the class will be diachronic: we will be following and reading about the posture of the U.S. on nuclear weapons issues in the international arena through the decades, as well as on domestic developments concerning nuclear weapons.

Yet, if such a concept is to have the theoretical force policy makers and theorists would like, more clarity is needed regarding what \"fanaticism\" is and how it operates.\nThis course examines the genealogy of fanaticism as a political concept. Who are political fanatics? What are the political (and psychological) consequences to \"us\" in labeling others as \"fanatics\"? How might we distinguish between fundamentalism and fanaticism? Is fanaticism necessary to define the limits of toleration or representation or an open civil society? Is fanaticism always dangerous to democratic politics, or can it be usefully employed to reshape that politics? This course will use these questions to explore fanaticism and its critiques, especially as the concept developed in relation to the history of liberal democracy.

In his comedies, \n and \n, and in his most famous work, \n, Machiavelli investigated the question of identity in light of the propensity of people to judge by appearances rather than essences. With a contiguity between the divine and the earthly no longer presupposed, Machiavelli made the radical proposal that perhaps appearances were all that mattered in political life, and he did not flinch at the consequences of such a proposal. At the same time, in his \n, Machiavelli proposed an understanding of the foundations of citizenship in \u201ccivic virtue\u201d that seemed to demand something more than appearances.

In it we find new conceptions of political rationality and affect (how to think and feel about politics), as well as reconceptualizations of such key concepts as equality and liberty, the state and civil society. These changes held much promise, shaping institutions that seemed destined to improve economic and social conditions for rapidly increasing populations. Yet the politics that ensued from this \"modern\" thinking sometimes proved disastrous: The 20th century \u2013 once thought to fulfill the promise of modernity \u2013 has been the most violent in history. This course surveys the development of political concepts in modern Western thought. We will trace paradigmatic shifts in political ideas as they begin to surface in 17th- and 18th-century European thought, evidenced in the writings of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant, amongst others. And we will compare these ideas with the thinking of some prominent 19th- and 20th-century critics, including Marx, Nietzsche, Weber, and Schmitt. Through close textual readings and contextual analysis we will engage in a systematic comparison of our assumptions about politics with those expressed in these philosophical debates. And, in so doing, we will attempt to further our understanding of contemporary politics and the problems requisite to our own political practices.","Department Code":"POSC","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1415S/POSC/POSC-245-1415S'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite:\u00a0 One course in POSC or LJST.\u00a0 Spring semester.\u00a0 Professor Poe."]},"color":"rgb(59, 223, 160)","size":10.0},{"label":"POSC-232","x":22.0,"y":2.0,"id":"18","attributes":{"Title":"Political Economy of Development","Description":"Listed in: \n, as POSC-232\nFormerly listed as: POSC-15\u00a0 | \u00a0POSC-32\nMoodle site: \n (Section 01)\n[IL, G]\u00a0This course surveys some of the principal themes in the political economy of lower-income countries.

In this module we will examine the views of those intellectuals and politicians who\u2013-already during the interwar period\u2013-began advocating the formation of a European federation, a United States of Europe, and discuss how that process of integration eventually unfolded after WWII: from the formation of the ECSC in 1951 to the formal establishment of the EU in 1993 via the Maastricht Treaty and its most recent expansions.\nThe second module takes a closer look at the different levels of European integration: military, economic, financial, political, and also cultural.

We will discuss the recurrent objections to this process of integration and the way the EU is currently functioning and evaluate to what extent the objections of Eurosceptics are justified.\nThroughout the course the students will be guided through the history of the making of the EU and its institutions and will also get to know what the current power balances in Europe are--not only among the different member states of the EU but also within its most powerful members.

This section will explore the extent to which oil is a \u201cresource curse,\u201d the neo-structuralist notion that an abundance of a natural resource, in this case oil, is detrimental for development because it distorts economic incentives (away from diversification) and distorts politics (by facilitating corruption, raising the stakes of power-holding, increasing the chance for abuse of state power, and weakening society\u2019s capacity to hold the state accountable). We will examine these hypotheses by focusing on Venezuela, one of the world\u2019s leading oil producers. Until the 1980s, Venezuela was considered an example of democratization. In the 1990s, Venezuela became instead a paradigmatic case of policy incoherence. In the early 2000s, under the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez administration, Venezuela became a case of political polarization, and some argue, rising authoritarianism. The second half of this course will assess whether the resource-curse theory provides the best account of Venezuela\u2019s politics since the 1980s. To address this question, we will: (1) compare the resource-curse argument with other competing theories of development that might account for Venezuelan politics; and (2) compare the Venezuelan case with other cases in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. \nNot open to students who have taken POSC 232.

The roots of obligation and law are the same: \u201cligare,\u201d to bind. When the law imposes a decision, it restricts personal freedom and displaces \u201cprivate choice\u201d in favor of a public obligation, an obligation applied uniformly or universally. The law may commit us then on matters that run counter even to our own convictions, strongly held, about the things that are right or wrong, and even on matters of our private lives. The law may forbid people to discriminate on grounds of race even in their private businesses; the law may forbid abortions or, on the other hand, the law may compel the funding of abortions even by people who find them abhorrent. This state of affairs, this logic of the law, has always called out for justification, and in facing that question, we are led back to the original understanding of the connection between morality and law. The law can justify itself only if it can establish, as its ground, propositions about the things that are in principle right or wrong, just or unjust-which is to say, right or wrong, just or unjust, for others as well as ourselves. The questions of law and obligation then must point to the questions at the root of moral philosophy: What is the nature of the good or the just, and the grounds on which we may claim to \u201cknow\u201d moral truths?\nThe course will proceed through a series of cases after it returns to the beginning of political philosophy and lays the groundwork for the argument. We will begin with Aristotle on the polis, and the debate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas on \u201cnatural rights.\u201d We will draw on Kant and Hume, on Thomas Reid and Bertrand Russell, as we seek to set the groundwork in place. The argument of the course will then be unfolded further, and tested, through a train of cases and problems: conscientious objection, the war in Vietnam, the obligation to rescue, the claims of privacy.

We will examine the status of these issues in various key cases and the way that scholars, mostly in the social sciences, have tried to explain the changes that have taken place (or failed to take place) across the Americas. We will also examine the consequences of legal rights moving faster than societal acceptance in some countries.

This exercise entails assessing the conditions under which states, civil societies, and political societies recognize certain identities while ignoring or repressing others. In other words, it entails analyzing the ways in which political processes make and remake identities. What do groups gain and lose from identity-based movements?

But what is geopolitics and why is it as often berated as it is embraced by American politicians and policy elites alike? Over the past two centuries, what part has geopolitics played in the currents of world politics and in the conduct of American foreign policy? What role has geopolitics played in the post-Cold War era, after the demise of the Soviet Union and the ostensible triumph of liberal capitalism? Although my approach is broadly historical, the main focus of the course will be on the post-Cold War period during which the U.S. has become the preponderant global actor. This is also a period which has been characterized by growing tension between two sets of political power dynamics: one is dominated by a territorial logic of power that has as its basis the direct control of specific territory, people and resources; the other is dominated by a more diffuse logic of power that derives from the command of \u201cde-territorialized\u201d global political, economic, technological and cultural forces which emanate from states as well as stateless groups with a global and transnational reach. In an attempt to better understand world politics in the age of America\u2019s preponderance, the course will ultimately examine how American presidents have understood and navigated between these two sets of political power dynamics in articulating and conducting foreign policy, and how the American public and elites have facilitated or complicated this task.\nLimited to 20 students.
