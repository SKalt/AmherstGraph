Both widely available and largely visible in nineteenth-century France, prostitutes inspired many negative stereotypes. But, as the very product of the culture that marginalized her, the prostitute offered an ideal vehicle for writers to criticize the hypocrisy of bourgeois mores. The socially stratified world of prostitutes, ranging from low-ranking sex workers to high-class courtesans, presents a fascinating microcosm of French society as a whole. We will read selections from Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, \n; Victor Hugo, \n; and Gustave Flaubert, \n; as well as \n and other stories by Guy de Maupassant; \n by Edmond de Goncourt; \n by Emile Zola; \n by Joris-Karl Huysmans; \n by Alexandre Dumas fils; and extracts from \n by Marcel Proust. Additional readings will be drawn from the fields of history (Alain Corbin, Michelle Perrot) and critical theory (Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Julia Kristeva). We will also discuss visual representations of prostitutes in nineteenth-century French art (Gavarni, Daumier, C. Guys, Degas, Manet, Toulouse-Lautrec). Conducted in French.\n60.00","Department Code":"SWAG","Course Site":"<a href= 'http://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1516F/SWAG/SWAG-342-1516F'> Course Site </a>","Requisite":["Requisite: One of the following--FREN 207, 208, 311 or equivalent.
