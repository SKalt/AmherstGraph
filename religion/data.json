Originating in Europe and North America but now a global phenomenon, evangelicalism in the United States has enjoyed periods of pervasive influence and times of cultural marginality--recovering in the late twentieth century a mainstream status it had seemingly lost.\u00a0 This course is concerned with the history and shifting nature of evangelicalism.\u00a0 Sometimes regarded as a monolithic movement adhering to a fixed set of traditional Christian doctrines and practices, evangelicalism has been throughout its history innovative, changing, and internally diverse. Sometimes seen as politically reactionary, evangelicalism has at times promoted recognizably progressive reforms. Sometimes seen as serving an ethnically and racially narrow constituency, evangelicalism has also shown a marked capacity to cross ethnic and racial boundaries. How are these seemingly contradictory patterns (or perceptions) to be understood?\u00a0 Over the course of the semester we will explore questions such as: \u00a0How have evangelicals themselves attempted to define the\"mainstream\" culture in the various environments they have entered?\u00a0 How has evangelicalism handled racial and ethnic difference?

In fact, since 9/11\u2014from Islamic terrorism (followed by anti-Islamic hate crimes) and America\u2019s wars in the Middle East to Mitt Romney\u2019s Mormonism and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate\u2014religion has played a role in almost every major debate in American politics and domestic and foreign policy, and often in American popular culture, too. To understand these debates, Americans open their newspapers (or smartphones), and turn on their radios and televisions. And yet, many journalists and commentators know very little about religion. In this course, we examine why and how the media fails to \u201cget religion,\u201d and how members of the media can get religion better: to write and comment on news events and popular culture with religious components with greater insight and accuracy.  In part I, \u201cthe Report,\u201d we examine the best and worst practices of religion reporting.
