In the early weeks of the seminar, discussion will be focused on several compelling texts (e.g., Rachel Carson\u2019s \n or Alan Weisman\u2019s \n) which will be considered from a variety of disciplinary perspectives by members of the Environmental Studies faculty. These discussions are intended to help students initiate an independent research project which may be expanded into an honors project in the second semester. For students not electing an honors project, the seminar will offer an opportunity to integrate what they have learned in their environmental studies courses. The substance of the seminar will vary from year to year, reflecting the interests of the faculty who will be convening and participating in the seminar.\nOpen to seniors. Fall semester.
